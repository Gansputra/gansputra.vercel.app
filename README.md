# Gansputra Portfolio

A state-of-the-art portfolio website that merges software engineering with cinematic digital art. This project features a highly dynamic visual identity that synchronizes in real-time with audio and user interaction.

Built with **Next.js 15**, **Framer Motion**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Music Theme Sync**: A signature feature where the entire website's color palette, neon highlights, and gradients adapt dynamically to the currently playing music track.
- **Interactive Vortex Background**: A high-performance canvas-based particle system that reacts to the theme's hue and provides a living backdrop for the content.
- **Global Parallax Architecture**: Multilayered depth effects across all sections, creating a cinematic and immersive browsing experience.
- **Modern AMV Showcase**: Advanced video gallery with a premium horizontal-scrolling filter system and high-performance playback previews.
- **Premium Glassmorphism**: High-contrast, opaque UI components designed for maximum readability against complex dynamic backgrounds.
- **Mobile Optimized**: GPU-accelerated animations using `willChange` and optimized re-renders for consistent 60FPS performance on all devices.
- **Zero-Hydration Mismatch Architecture**: Implemented robust mount-gating patterns for flawless SSR/CSR transitions in Next.js.
